you are free to use this model as you please.

you can also redistribute these files also as you see fit however I ask you add the textures for the credits material and do not remove it from the model.

I make models for the sake of creativity and expression
However I have real world struggles that get in the way of me being able to do so, as such. I would appricate any donations or tips that head my way.

Also with how v4 is designed be aware of how well you optimize it. make sure you do not have seperated meshes or too many materials.. or else the ghost of performance past will come get you at 3am.

And DO NOT USE CATS FOR ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF IMPORTING MMD CLOTHING OR EXPORTING CATS WILL BREAK THE MODEL.
